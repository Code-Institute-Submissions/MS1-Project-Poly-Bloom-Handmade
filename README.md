# Poly Bloom Handmade 

<img src="./assets/images/polyms1.png">

This is a static product website made in accordance with the guidelines for my 1st Milestone Project in the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Course.<br>

Poly Bloom Handmade is a real business dedicated to designing handmade, quality and unique polymer clay earrings based in Morelos Mexico.


## UX

### Project Aim

I decided to make this site in order to promote Poly Bloom Handmade. My plan was to build an attractive, intuitive and infomative website that represented the elegance and simplicity associated with the products on sale. 

My intentions were to improve overall customer interaction and brand awareness. Keeping customers up to date with the brand's social feed was a high priority as well as having links nested within the site to the online store where actual Poly Bloom Hanmade products can be purchased.


### User Stories

<ul>
    <li>As an owner I want to be able to promote my brand and my products online.</li>
    <li>As an owner I want to instill a sense of luxury and simplicity represented by an intuitive and well laid out website that offers ease of browsing to my customers.</li>
    <li>As an owner I want the ability to keep my audience engaged with new content.</li>
    <li>As a user I want to be able to find what I'm looking for within the least number of clicks.</li>
    <li>As a user I want to purchase Poly Bloom Handmade products easily through the site.</li>
    <li>As a user I want to be able to find the company through all of it's social media and other online platforms.</li>
    <li>As a new potential customer I want to immediately understand the sentiment behind the brand and get a feeling for the quality of the products on offer through positive verified customer reviews.</li>
</ul>

The website is spread out over 4 pages:
<ul>
<li>Home - Users are introduced to the brand with a heading outlining the name and some introductory text explaining the product. I included an Instagram Feed widget in order to keep users up to date with the social media element of the business.</li><br>
<li>About - A brief biography section outlines the origin of the company, it's owner and her vision for the brand.</li><br>
<li>Shop - A storefront with a gallery of collections for the customer to browse with functional links to real products on the company's Etsy page. There is also a customer reviews section to improve the brand's reputation.</li><br>
<li>Contact - A means for the customer to sign up to a future monthly newsletter from Poly Bloom Handmade.</li>
</ul>

Within the footer there are functioning links to various social media platforms and a link to the online Etsy store where Poly Bloom Handmade products can be purchased.

Using Bootstrap 4 allowed for this project to be responsive on all devices with an emphasis on a mobile first design approach.

## External Libraries and Technology Used

I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap4 to build and design the website layout. I also used fontawesome for the social media icons, Google Fonts for fonts.

For the color used in the navbar, footer, buttons and horizontal rules I used Adobe Color Wheel.

All technologies used were chosen due to my experience with using them from the modules on the Code Institute Front End Developer course.

## Features


### Included Features

Home Page - I included an Instagram Feed Widget to keep users up to date with the company. A widget was chosen as it was the most efficient way to implement what I wanted given my limited coding experience.

Shop Page - Real working links to where Poly Bloom Handmade products could be purchased are nested in the images and product names displayed on the site.

Contact Page - A sign up for a fictional monthly newsletter is included on the contact page.

### Future Features

Given my inexperience, I will later add a fully functional online store to the Shop page with the possibility to buy products directly from the site.

The monthly newsletter is something I intend to make a reality soon as well as a blog section for the website.

I will improve the Instagram feed once I have the tools to do so.

## Testing 

Navbar - All links are functional and perform as desired. Navbar is responsive across all devices.

Home Page - Instagram feed links directly to the Poly Bloom Handmade Instagram page. 

Sections - Are responsive across all devices and functioning as desired. 

Contact Form - Is fully functional and returns all input information as designed. 

Footer - All links are functional and open into a new page when clicked.

I uploaded the link to my Github pages for this projectt for peer review on Slack.

I also ran the code through the Mobile-Friendly Test at https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly.
