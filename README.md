# Poly Bloom Handmade 

<img src="./assets/images/polyms1.png">
This is a static product website made in accordance with the guidelines for my 1st Milestone Project in the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer Course.

Poly Bloom Handmade is a real business dedicated to designing handmade, quality and unique polymer clay earrings based in Morelos Mexico.


## UX

I decided to make this site in order to promote Poly Bloom Handmade. My plan was to build an attractive, intuitive and infomative website that showcased the elegance and simplicity associated with these earrings.

I included a navbar and footer across all pages to maintain design continuity. The fonts, colors and sizing across all pages also follow continuity.

The intended outcome for this project was:
<ul>
<li>To generate sales through a shop page where customers could browse collections resulting in increased revenue for the company.</li><br>
<li>To improve brand awareness by providing a platform for new and existing customers to view Poly Bloom Handmade products.</li><br>
<li>To keep customers updated and engaged by offering a monthly newsletter and an up to date Instagram feed.</li>
</ul>

The website is spread out over 4 pages:
<ul>
<li>Home - Users are introduced to the brand with a H1 outlining the name and some introductory text explaining the product. I included an Instagram Feed widget in order to keep users up to date with the social media element of the business.</li><br>
<li>About - A brief biography section outlines the origin of the company and it's vision.</li><br>
<li>Shop - A storefront with a gallery of collections for the customer to browse with functional links to real products on the company's Etsy page. There is also a customer reviews section to improve the brand's reputation.</li><br>
<li>Contact - A means for the customer to sign up to a monthly newsletter from Poly Bloom Handmade.</li>
</ul>

Within the footer there are functioning links to various social media platforms and a link to the online Etsy store where Poly Bloom Handmade products can be purchased.

Using Bootstrap 4 allowed for this project to be responsive on all devices with an emphasis on a mobile first design approach.

## External Libraries and Technology Used

I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap4 to build and design the website layout. I also used fontawesome for the social media icons, Google Fonts for fonts.

For the color used in the navbar, footer, buttons and horizontal rules I used Adobe Color Wheel.

All technologies used were chosen due to my experience with using them from the modules on the Code Institute Front End Developer course.

## Features


### Included Features

Home Page - I included an Instagram Feed Widget to keep users up to date with the company. A widget was chosen as it was the most efficient way to implement what I wanted given my limited coding experience.

Shop Page - Real working links to where Poly Bloom Handmade products could be purchased are nested in the images and product names displayed on the site.

Contact Page - A sign up for a fictional monthly newsletter is included on the contact page.

### Future Features

Given my inexperience, I will later add a fully functional online store to the Shop page with the possibility to buy products directly from the site.

The monthly newsletter is something I intend to make a reality soon as well as a blog section for the website.

I will improve the Instagram feed once I have the tools to do so.

## Testing 

Navbar - All links are functional and perform as desired. Navbar is responsive across all devices.

Home Page - Instagram feed links directly to the Poly Bloom Handmade Instagram page. 

Sections - Are responsive across all devices and functioning as desired. 

Contact Form - Is fully functional and returns all input information as designed. 

Footer - All links are functional and open into a new page when clicked.

I uploaded the link to my Github pages for this projectt for peer review on Slack.

I also ran the code through the Mobile-Friendly Test at https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly.
